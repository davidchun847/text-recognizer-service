## text-recognizer-service

# Feature
This project is text recognizer service to predict a text from an handwriting img using deep learning. The [model](https://github.com/full-stack-deep-learning/fsdl-text-recognizer-2021-labs) is based on resnet transformer. 

# Development:
- Tools: Python, Pytorch, TorchLighning, Flask, Docker, wandb  <br/>
- Period: 22.01 ~ 22.04 (working) <br/>
- Team size: 1 (David Chun) <br/>

# Contributions:
- Code refactored to reduce the duplicate codes <br/>
- Make it works in Windows 10 as well <br/>
- Add docker compose to run train and service without cmd options (WORKING) <br/>
- Add BentoML service (WORK_TO_DO) <br/>
